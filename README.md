# DANNY'S DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my portfolio website, I made it from scratch, cool right. Here you'll find my code you can branch off and adapt it to make your own website. Also you'll find infomation about resources used within the website.

## Github repo

This is the [link] (https://github.com/dannylanda/developer-portfolio) to the Github repo of the project. This is the main code base and any changes here continously push to our live website.

## Sample Website

A live demo is already available via this [link](https://eager-williams-af0d00.netlify.app/?)

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaSCript

## UI/UX 

My design process was to be modern, fun, vibrant, and at the same time a little bit dynamic (like myself). It is designed to be minimal and not too 
cluttered, while at the same time being quite clean and functionable. 

## Tools Used

Below are are list of tools used, and the precise things they were used for:

- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for hambuger menu bar
- [Drawkit](https://www.drawkit.io/) for Coder illustration
- [Icon8](https://icons8.com/) for animated icons and skills icons
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for contact form submision and straight delivery to Gmail

## Folder Structure

The index.html and readme files are in the root folder, alongside the screenshot included in the readme.

The assets folder contains the CSS and JavaScript files, all images and icons used, in their respective folders.

## Customization Guide

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, to understand what does what.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons.

For the form submission, formspree was used. Submissions will be delivered straignt into the specified email account.

In addition to formspree, you can also use Netlify form submission in case you deploy there. Brad Traversy has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElQ689HRcY) on how to do it.

## CI/CD 

This site is hosted through Netlify, I am leveraging a CI/CD feature which continously pushes changes made on my local code base, up to my live site.

If you encounter problems customizing, reach out to me by sending me a DM on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/koladechris).
