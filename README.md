## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaSCript

## Tools Used

Below are are list of tools used, and the precise things they were used for:

- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for hambuger menu bar
- [Drawkit](https://www.drawkit.io/) for Coder illustration
- [Icon8](https://icons8.com/) for animated icons and skills icons
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for contact form submision and straight delivery to Gmail

## Folder Structure

The index.html and readme files are in the root folder, alongside the screenshot included in the readme.

The assets folder contains the CSS and JavaScript files, all images and icons used, in their respective folders.

## Customization Guide

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, to understand what does what.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons.

For the form submission, formspree was used. Submissions will be delivered straignt into the specified email account.

In addition to formspree, you can also use Netlify form submission in case you deploy there. Brad Traversy has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElQ689HRcY) on how to do it.
